# gaming-center-app

This is a website that offers different information about a gaming center and all its services. 
It also includes a personal profile / account for the players of the gaming center, where they can find their information about the games played, achievements and personal stats.

# Technical details

In this project I have used:

- CSS
- Javascript

# Project Structure

The project has a main folder called `app` where are all the components and a folder called `assets` where are all medias (images, videos). 
Inside the  `app` folder every component contains three files: `.html`, `.js`, `.css` , and two global files one for css and one for javascript.
